                As a researcher in earth science, Dr. Feng is deeply concerned about climate change and its impacts on the earth and human. Her research focuses on 
                analyzing natural disturbance including hurricanes, fire, and drought using Google Earth Engine remote sensing, deep learning, and statistical tools. 
                She is excited about the opportunities to build models to study the impacts of natural disasters on forest ecosystems under the climate change situation. 
                Years of research experience in climate change impacts transit her interests to actionable climate solutions. She has worked on bioenergy with carbon 
                capture and storage, and she is working on nature-based solutions.
