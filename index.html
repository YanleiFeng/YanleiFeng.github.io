        <p>As a researcher in earth science, Dr. Feng is deeply concerned about climate change and its impacts on the earth and human. Her research focus on 
            analyzing natural disturbance including hurricanes, fire, and drought using Google Earth Engine remote sensing, deep learning, and statistical tools. 
            She is excited about the opportunities to build models to study the impacts of natural disasters on forest ecosystem under climate change situation. 
            Years of research experience in climate change impacts transit her interests to actionable climate solutions. She has worked on bioenergy with carbon 
            capture and storage, and she is working on nature-based solutions.
